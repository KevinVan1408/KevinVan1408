- 👋 Hi, I’m @KevinVan1408
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, design, maybe in computer science too (I love it so much :))))...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about coding and in the future this will continue, because learning is something that lasts forever.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on companies that really trust and respect me through the projects I've done. 
      Plus, they'll see my talent that exists after the projects I have posted on GitHub until now.
- 📫 How to reach me: Contact me through email ----> trongvan14082002@gmail.com
